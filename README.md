## Short description

In this project, we studied two different machine learning algorithms, **Neuroevolution** and **Q-Learning**, to learn how to play the (in)famous game of **Flappy Bird**.

**Neuroevolution** is a machine learning technique that applies evolutionary algorithms to construct artificial neural networks, taking inspiration from the evolution of biological nervous systems in nature. The final result [here](https://github.com/lucabonengel/FlappyProject/blob/main/BirdsProject/index.html).

**Q-learning** is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of an action in a particular state.
