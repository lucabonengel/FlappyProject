# Reinforcement learning project with Flappy Bird

### Creators:

## Short description

In this project, we studied two different machine learning algorithms, **Neuroevolution** and **Q-Learning**, to learn how to play the (in)famous game of **Flappy Bird**.

**Neuroevolution** is a machine learning technique that applies evolutionary algorithms to construct artificial neural networks, taking inspiration from the evolution of biological nervous systems in nature. The video below shows the result of our work on neuroevolution.

**Q-learning** is a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm that learns the value of an action in a particular state. The video below shows the result of our work on q-learning.
